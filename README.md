# OpenGL-Scene
A 3d scene created in OpenGL.

The scene illustrates implementations of the following algorithms:
1. Phong lighting
2. Shadow Mapping
3. PCF for shadow enhancement
4. Cubemap
5. A simple fog effect

# How to explore the scene
1. WASD keys for moving around
2. Using the mouse rotates the camera
3. To turn the lighting on/off use the keys E/Q
4. To start/stop the presentation use the keys O/P
5. To trigger the fog on/off use the keys K/L
6. To switch between solid, wireframe and polygonal display mode use V,B and N.


# Disclaimer
All the models used in the scene were downloaded from the intenet, I do not own any of them.
The code of the application had a skeleton base which was given by the Graphics Department within the Technical University of Cluj-Napoca.
